# Project Overview

Welcome to my blogpost website project! This project is currently in development, and I'm building it to enhance my skills in web development using Flask. The inspiration for this project comes from tutorials by [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH), and I'm excited to apply the concepts I'm learning.

## Learning Goals

As I work on this project, my primary learning goals include:

- Mastering Flask fundamentals.
- Gaining hands-on experience with building dynamic web applications.
- Exploring various concepts such as routing, templates, and forms in Flask.

Feel free to check out the source code and follow along with my progress. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are highly appreciated as I continue to refine and improve this project.
